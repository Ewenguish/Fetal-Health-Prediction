# Context
This dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into 3 classes:

1- Normal
2- Suspect
3- Pathological

Cardiotocograms (CTGs) are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.

The aim of this project is to use the classifcation of fetal health to prevent child and maternal mortality. Automating the process of fetal diagnosis can greatly help medical personnel.
